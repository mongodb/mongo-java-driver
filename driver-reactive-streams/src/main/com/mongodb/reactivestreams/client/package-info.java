/**
 * This packages contains classes for the reactive stream client implementation.
 * <p>
 * All API {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher}s are
 * <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/reactiveProgramming.html#reactive.hotCold">cold</a>,
 * meaning that nothing happens until they are subscribed to.
 * So just creating a {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher} won’t cause any network IO.
 * It’s not until {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher#subscribe(org.reactivestreams.Subscriber)} is called that the driver executes the
 * operation.
 * <p>
 * All API {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher}s are unicast.
 * Each {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscription} to a {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher} relates to a single MongoDB operation and its
 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscriber} will receive its own specific set of results.
