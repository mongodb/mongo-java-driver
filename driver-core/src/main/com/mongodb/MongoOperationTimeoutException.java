/**
 * Exception thrown to indicate that a MongoDB operation has exceeded the specified timeout for
 * the full execution of operation.
 *
 * <p>The {@code MongoOperationTimeoutException} might provide information about the underlying
 * cause of the timeout, if available. For example, if retries are attempted due to transient failures,
 * and a timeout occurs in any of the attempts, the exception from one of the retries may be appended
 * as the cause to this {@code MongoOperationTimeoutException}.
 *
 * <p>The key difference between {@code MongoOperationTimeoutException} and {@code MongoExecutionTimeoutException}
 * lies in the nature of these exceptions. {@code MongoExecutionTimeoutException} indicates a server-side timeout
 * capped by a user-specified number. These server errors are transformed into the new {@code MongoOperationTimeoutException}.
 * On the other hand, {@code MongoOperationExecutionException} denotes a timeout during the execution of the entire operation.
