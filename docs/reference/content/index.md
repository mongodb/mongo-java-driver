### MongoDB Async Driver

For the callback-based asynchronous MongoDB Async Driver, see [MongoDB Async Driver section]({{< relref "driver-async/index.md" >}}). Note 
that this driver has been deprecated in favor of the

### BSON Library

“documents".  The [reference guide]({{< relref "bson/index.md">}}) provides information about working with [Documents]({{< relref "bson/documents.md">}}),
how to use [Codecs]({{< relref "bson/codecs.md">}}) and [Extended JSON]({{< relref "bson/extended-json.md">}}) support.
