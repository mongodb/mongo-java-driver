/**
 * A `Observable` represents a MongoDB operation and implements the `Publisher` interface.
 *
 * As such it is a provider of a potentially unbounded number of sequenced elements, publishing them according to the demand received
 * from its [[Observer]](s).
 *
 * Extends the `Publisher` interface and adds helpers to make Observables composable and simple to Subscribe to.
 *
 * Special parameterizations:
 *
 *   - `Observable[Unit]` must emit exactly one item by signalling [[Observer.onNext]]
 *   if it terminates successfully by signalling [[Observer.onComplete]].
 *   - `Observable[Void]` cannot emit an item. It is not exposed by the driver API because it is not convenient to work with in Scala.
 *
 * @define forComprehensionExamples
 *         Example:
 *
 *         {{{
 *             def f = Observable(1 to 10)
 *             def g = Observable(100 to 100)
 *             val h = for {
 *               x: Int <- f // returns Observable(1 to 10)
 *               y: Int <- g // returns Observable(100 to 100)
 *             } yield x + y
 *         }}}
 *
 *         is translated to:
 *
 *         {{{
 *            f flatMap { (x: Int) => g map { (y: Int) => x + y } }
 *         }}}
