/**
 * Signifies that the annotated program element is subject to incompatible changes by means of adding abstract methods.
 * This, in turn, means that implementing interfaces or extending classes annotated with {@link Evolving} bears the risk
 * of doing extra work during upgrades.
 * Using such program elements is no different from using ordinary unannotated program elements.
 * Note that the presence of this annotation implies nothing about the quality or performance of the API in question.
 * <p>
 * Unless we currently want to allow users to extend/implement API program elements, we must annotate them with
 * {@code @}{@link Sealed} rather than {@code @}{@link Evolving}. Replacing {@code @}{@link Sealed} with {@code @}{@link Evolving}
 * is a backward-compatible change, while the opposite is not.</p>
