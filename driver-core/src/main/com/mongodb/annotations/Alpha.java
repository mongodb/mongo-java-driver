/**
 * Signifies that a public API element is in the early stages of development, subject to
 * incompatible changes, or even removal, in a future release and may lack some intended features.
 * An API bearing this annotation may contain known issues affecting functionality, performance,
 * and stability. It is also exempt from any compatibility guarantees made by its containing library.
 *
 * <p>It is inadvisable for <i>applications</i> to use Alpha APIs in production environments or
 * for <i>libraries</i> (which get included on users' CLASSPATHs, outside the library developers'
 * control) to depend on these APIs. Alpha APIs are intended for <b>experimental purposes</b> only.</p>
