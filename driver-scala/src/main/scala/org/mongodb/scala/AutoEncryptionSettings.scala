/**
 * The client-side automatic encryption settings. In-use encryption enables an application to specify what fields in a collection
 * must be encrypted, and the driver automatically encrypts commands sent to MongoDB and decrypts responses.
 *
 * Automatic encryption is an enterprise only feature that only applies to operations on a collection. Automatic encryption is not
 * supported for operations on a database or view and will result in error. To bypass automatic encryption,
 * set bypassAutoEncryption=true in `AutoEncryptionSettings`.
 *
 * Explicit encryption/decryption and automatic decryption is a community feature, enabled with the new
 * `com.mongodb.client.vault.ClientEncryption` type.
 *
 * A MongoClient configured with bypassAutoEncryption=true will still automatically decrypt.
 *
 * If automatic encryption fails on an operation, use a MongoClient configured with bypassAutoEncryption=true and use
 * ClientEncryption#encrypt to manually encrypt values.
 *
 * Enabling client side encryption reduces the maximum document and message size (using a maxBsonObjectSize of 2MiB and
 * maxMessageSizeBytes of 6MB) and may have a negative performance impact.
 *
 * Automatic encryption requires the authenticated user to have the listCollections privilege action.
 *
 * Supplying an `encryptedFieldsMap` provides more security than relying on an encryptedFields obtained from the server.
 * It protects against a malicious server advertising false encryptedFields.
