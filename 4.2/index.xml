      <description>Client Side Encryption New in MongoDB 4.2 client side encryption allows administrators and developers to encrypt specific data fields in addition to other MongoDB encryption features.
With field level encryption, developers can encrypt fields client side without any server-side configuration or directives. Client-side field level encryption supports workloads where applications must guarantee that unauthorized parties, including server administrators, cannot read the encrypted data.

      <description>Change Streams MongoDB 3.6 introduces a new $changeStream aggregation pipeline operator.
Change streams provide a way to watch changes to documents in a collection. To improve the usability of this new stage, the MongoCollection API includes a new watch method. The ChangeStreamPublisher sets up the change stream and automatically attempts to resume if it encounters a potentially recoverable error.
Prerequisites  The example below requires a restaurants collection in the test database.</description>

      <description>POJOs - Plain Old Java Objects The 3.5 release of the driver adds POJO support via the PojoCodecProvider, which allows for direct serialization of POJOs and Java Beans to and from BSON. Internally, the Codec for each POJO utilizes a ClassModel instance to store metadata about how the POJO should be serialized.
A ClassModel for a POJO includes:
 The class of the POJO. A new instance factory. Handling the creation of new instances of the POJO.</description>

      <description>Macros New in 2.0, the Scala driver allows you to use case classes to represent documents in a collection via the Macros helper. Simple case classes and nested case classes are supported. Hierarchical modelling can be achieve by using a sealed trait or class and having case classes implement the parent trait.
Many simple Scala types are supported and they will be marshaled into their corresponding BsonValue type. Below is a list of Scala types and their type-safe BSON representation:</description>

      <description>GridFS GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving files that exceed the BSON document size limit of 16MB. Instead of storing a file in a single document, GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks, and stores each of those chunks as a separate document.
When you query a GridFS store for a file, the Java driver will reassemble the chunks as needed.

 The Reactive Streams driver now utilizes Project Reactor internally. Project reactor follows the Reactive Streams specification and has greatly simplified the implementation of the driver. Added support for Azure and GCP key stores to client-side field level encryption. Added support for caching Kerberos tickets so that they can be re-used for multiple authentication requests.</description>

      <description>Observables The MongoDB Scala Driver is an asynchronous and non blocking driver. Using the Observable model asynchronous events become simple, composable operations, freed from the complexity of nested callbacks.
For asynchronous operations there are three interfaces Observable, Subscription and Observer.
Note The MongoDB Scala driver is now built upon the MongoDB Reactive Streams driver and is an implementation of the reactive streams specification. Observerables are implementations of Publishers and Observers are implementations of Subscribers.</description>

      <description>Codec and CodecRegistry In the last section we saw how to use the BsonReader and BsonWriter API to read and write BSON documents. But writing code at that low a level is tedious and error-prone, so in practice these algorithms are packaged in implementations of the Codec interface.
Codec The Codec interface abstracts the processes of decoding a BSON value into a Java object using a BsonReader and encoding a Java object into a BSON value using a BsonWriter.</description>

      <description>Documents The driver includes several classes and interfaces used for representing BSON documents.
important The server&amp;rsquo;s behavior related to duplicate key names in a document is undefined. When a document with duplicate key names is decoded, the driver will assign the last value associated with the duplicate key. Storing such a document will cause the other values to be lost.
 BsonDocument Although generally not needed by users of the high-level driver API, the BsonDocument class is central to the way that documents are managed internally by the driver.</description>

      <description>Documents The scala driver includes two scala specific representations for BSON documents. Following convention from the scala collections library, there are immutable and mutable implementations of documents. The underlying implementations of the scala Document use the type safe BsonDocument class. The scala bson classes are available from the org.mongodb.scala.bson namespace, which includes type aliases and companion objects. In general this should suffice but for advanced use cases you may need to use org.</description>

      <description>JSON As discussed earlier, the Java driver supports reading and writing BSON documents represented as JSON values. The driver supports four standard variants:
 Extended Mode: Canonical representation that avoids any loss of BSON type information. See the Extended JSON specification for a description of this mode. Relaxed Mode: Relaxed representation that loses type information for BSON numeric types and uses a more human-readable representation of BSON dates. See the Extended JSON specification for a description of this mode.</description>

      <description>Issues &amp;amp; Help We are lucky to have a vibrant MongoDB Java community with lots of varying experience of using the Java driver. We often find the quickest way to get support for general questions is through the MongoDB Community Forums or through stackoverflow. Please also refer to our own support channels documentation.
Bugs / Feature Requests If you think you’ve found a bug or want to see a new feature in the Java driver, please open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:</description>

      <description>Installation The recommended way to get started using one of the drivers in your project is with a dependency management system.
There are two Maven artifacts available in the release. The preferred artifact for new applications is mongodb-driver-sync however, we still publish the legacy mongodb-driver-legacy jar.
 MongoDB Driver Sync The MongoDB Driver mongodb-driver-sync is the synchronous Java driver containing only the generic MongoCollection interface that complies with a new cross-driver CRUD specification.</description>

      <description>Installation The BSON library is a required dependency of all the MongoDB Java drivers and if using a dependency management system, it will be automatically installed alongside the driver, however, it can be used as a standalone library. The recommended way to get started using one of the drivers in your project is with a dependency management system.
 BSON This library comprehensively supports BSON, the data storage and network transfer format that MongoDB uses for &amp;ldquo;documents&amp;rdquo;.</description>
