/**
 * Builders for [[Window windows]] used when expressing [[WindowOutputField window output fields]].
 * There are two types of windows: documents and range.
 *
 * Bounded and half-bounded windows require sorting.
 * Window bounds are inclusive and the lower bound must always be less than or equal to the upper bound.
 * The following type-specific rules are applied to windows:
 *  - documents
 *    - bounds
 *      - 0 refers to the current document and is functionally equivalent to [[Windows.Bound CURRENT]];
 *      - a negative value refers to documents preceding the current one;
 *      - a positive value refers to documents following the current one;
 *  - range
 *    - `sortBy` (see `Aggregates.setWindowFields`)
 *      - must contain exactly one field;
 *      - must specify the ascending sort order;
 *      - the `sortBy` field must be of either a numeric BSON type
 *      (see the `\$isNumber` aggregation pipeline stage)
 *      or the BSON `Date` type if time
 *      bounds are used;
 *    - bounds
 *      - if numeric, i.e., not `com.mongodb.client.model.Windows.Bound`, then the bound is calculated by adding
 *      the value to the value of the `sortBy` field in the current document;
 *      - if [[Windows.Bound CURRENT]], then the bound is determined by the current document
 *      and not the current value of the `sortBy` field;
 *      - time bounds require specifying a [[MongoTimeUnit time unit]] and are added as per the
 *      `\$dateAdd`/`\$dateSubtract` aggregation pipeline stage specification.
 *
